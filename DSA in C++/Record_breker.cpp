     Problem
     Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive
     days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi

     . A day is record breaking if it

     satisfies both of the following conditions:
     ● The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of
     visitors on each of the previous days.
     ● Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger
     than the number of visitors on the following day.
     Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
     Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
     Input
     The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
     Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
     contains N integers. The i-th integer is Vi
     .

     Output
     For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
     number (starting from 1) and y is the number of record breaking days.
     Constraints
     Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
     Memory limit: 1GB.
     1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
     0 ≤ Vi ≤ 2 × 105
     .
     Test set 1
     1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

     Test set 2
     1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 105 for at most 10 test cases.
     For the remaining cases, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

     Solution
     Constraints Analysis

     1 sec = 108 operations
     20 sec = 2x109 operations

     Brute Force Approach
     Iterate over all the elements and check if it is record breaking day or not.
     Note: To check if a[i] is a record breaking day, we have to iterate over a[0],
     a[1],...., a[i-1].

     Time complexity for this operation: O(n)
     Overall Time Complexity: O(n2
     )

     Optimised Approach
     Intuition: If we can optimise step (1), then we can optimise our overall solution.
     For step (1): We need to check if a[i] > { a[i-1], a[i-2],..., a[0] }, which is same as

     a[i] > max(a[i-1], a[i-2],..., a[0])

     For this, we will keep a variable mx, which will store the maximum value till a[i].
     Then we just need to check,

     a[i] > mx
     a[i] > a[i+1] , { if i+1 < n }
     and update mx, mx = max(mx, a[i])
     So step (1) time complexity reduces to O(1).

     Overall time complexity: O(n)
